## Description
This application is a workout tracker for users to create and track their exercises. The front end code `Develop` folder was provided and I created the models, routes and server.js.

## Links
* Live Website: https://seattlesal-fitness-tracker.herokuapp.com/
* Github Link: https://github.com/SeattleSal/workout-tracker/

## User_Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Acceptance_Criteria
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.

## Dependencies
The dependencies are:
* [express](http://expressjs.com/) for the web framework
* [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) for the Object Modeling tool for use with MongoDB.
* [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) for the middleware. 

There is a `package.json` included, the following commands should be run to install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage
Use the links above to use the application live. If you prefer to run the application from your computer, you can use the following command after installing the dependencies:

```bash
node server.js
```

The application displays a homepage with information about the last workout. The user can add exercises to the last workout or create a new workout. When the user creates a new workout they can choose to add Cardio (Name, Distance, Duration) or Resistance (Name, Weight, Sets, Reps, Duration) exercises. The user can also see statistics of their last 7 workouts in the dashboard.
